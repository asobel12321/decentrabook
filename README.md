Decentralized Sports Betting Platform

Project Overview

This project aims to create a decentralized platform for sports betting, utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, transparent, and trustless betting transactions. 
By leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, our platform allows users to engage in direct peer-to-peer betting without the need for intermediaries. 
This approach significantly reduces the traditional fees ("juice") associated with sports betting, thereby offering a fairer and more equitable betting experience.

Goal
The primary goal of this platform is to revolutionize the sports betting industry by:

Reducing the cost of bets through minimal transaction fees.
Ensuring transparency and fairness in betting transactions.
Providing a secure and decentralized betting environment.
Empowering users with direct control over their betting activities.
